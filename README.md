# Data Analyst Home Assignment: URL Security Analysis

Hello! 👋
Welcome to my submission for the Data Analyst home assignment. The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of URL messages to identify infrastructure bottlenecks, quality issues, and service anomalies.

I used **Python (Pandas)** for the heavy lifting (cleaning and merging) and **Tableau** for the final visualizations.

🛠️ Tools & Environment
*   **Anaconda Navigator:** Used to manage my environment and launch Jupyter.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** My main workspace for coding.
*   **Python (Pandas, JSON):** Used for data wrangling.
*   **Tableau Public:** Used for creating the interactive dashboard.


**Note on SQL:** While the assignment mentioned SQL, I chose to perform the analysis entirely in **Python (Pandas)**. Since the data was provided as standalone JSON files (rather than a connection to a relational database), loading them directly into a DataFrame was more efficient and allowed me to handle the nested JSON structures (like the `redirects` lists) much faster.
